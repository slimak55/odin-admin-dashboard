# Odin Project

## Project Admin Dashboard

This is my take on the Admin Dashboard project. This one is also only frontend design project without any functionality. I did not completely changed the design into some imaginary app, but I changed few colors, and added some animations to simulate the feel of real button, which I realized several highly liked project did not do. I know it is not necessary to complete the project, but for me the project loses a bit of charm if it is just static, and even more when we are starting to work on the advanced stuff, and simple hover animations are so easy to make, and it also makes the project come to life.
